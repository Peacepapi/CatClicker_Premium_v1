# Cat Clicker Premium


## Description:

A web application that gives a selection of cats to click on from a menu. This revision is supposed to build upon Cat Clicker v2 but this time around, the app will be automated to allow for more cats to be added without affecting the functionality of the app. 

This app was made as an assignment from Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree.
